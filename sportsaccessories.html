<td style="background-color:#64d00f;font-size:20px;"><p>Cricket, often called "the gentleman's game," is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players. A typical match involves one team batting, attempting to score runs by hitting a bowled ball and running between two sets of wickets, while the fielding team tries to dismiss the batsmen. The game's rich history dates back centuries, originating in England and spreading globally, particularly through the Commonwealth nations. From the fast-paced Twenty20 format to the enduring five-day Test matches, cricket offers diverse variations catering to different preferences. Its blend of skill, strategy, and sportsmanship makes it a beloved pastime for millions worldwide.</p></td>

<td style="background-color:#64d00f;font-size:20px;"><p>Badminton is a dynamic racket sport played by two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles) across a net-divided court. Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket over the net so that it lands within the opponent's half of the court. Unlike tennis, the shuttlecock's unique aerodynamics, designed to create high drag, lead to a very different style of play emphasizing quick reflexes, agility, and precise shot placement. From powerful smashes to delicate drop shots, badminton demands a wide range of skills. It's a popular sport enjoyed recreationally and competitively worldwide, known for its fast pace and exhilarating rallies.</p></td>
